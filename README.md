# Internet Usage Clustering Using K-Means

This project analyzes user internet behavior and groups users into clusters based on:

- Daily device usage time
- Site categories visited
- Number of sessions per day

We used **K-Means clustering** and visualized results using a heatmap.

## Project Structure


---

##  Features

- Data preprocessing (scaling, cleaning)
- Clustering using K-Means
- Elbow method to find optimal `k`
- Heatmap to visualize cluster behavior

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

##  Results

- Cluster 0: Light users
- Cluster 1: Moderate users
- Cluster 2: Heavy users

Each group showed unique behavior patterns in terms of time spent, types of sites visited, and session frequency.

##  Future Scope

- Include features like device type or peak usage hours
- Use other clustering techniques (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- Deploy it as a web app for real-time usage classification
